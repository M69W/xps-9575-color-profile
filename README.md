# xps-9575-color-profile
### Introduction
I calibrate and profile my XPS 9575 UHD laptop using ColorMunki Display, DisplayCAL 3.6 and ArgyllCMS 2.0.
If you find your laptop oversaturated, you can try my [color profile](). I am still learning calibrating and profiling. If you find some issues about my color profile, please let me know.  

If you are doing professional stuff such as photo editing, you may need to calibrate and profile your laptop yourself since we may have different working environments.  

The profile can partly adjust the display for non color managed software. The color is correct only for color managed software, such as Chrome, Firefox, Adobe software, GIMP and so on. You may need to explicitly enable the color management for some of them.  

For color managed video playing, refer to [madvr](http://madvr.com/).
